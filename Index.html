    <h2>Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available
        for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a
        rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as
        .NET and Unity). </h2>
